This project is an offshoot of my dissertation work. Data collected for the dissertation project includes [[./Public Materials|publicly accessible information]] gathered from digital and physical archives, as well as information gathered directly from those with lived experience in the jails. 

The dissertation research has been reviewed by the NYU IRB, and strict restrictions are in place to ensure individuals' information is protected. Because of data restrictions, the material gathered from [[./Private Materials|local archives and from interviews]] is not published here. 

Furthermore, in this repository, to the extent possible, identifying information is only shared for public figures. This includes individuals elected to office, or who hold positions with decision-making authority in government. Identifying information of those incarcerated in the jails is not included in descriptions of events, but may be in linked materials. This is an intentional choice to ensure this repository does not serve as a tool for targeting any individuals. 

If you have ideas on how to improve the way information is presented here, please reach out to me at marianaveras@nyu.edu
